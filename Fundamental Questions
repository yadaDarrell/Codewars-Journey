2. Friend or Foe? 
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

#2 Solution 
def friend(x):
    shouldBe = []
    for names in x:
        if len(names) == 4:
            shouldBe.append(names)
        else:
            continue
    return shouldBe
x = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"]
print(friend(x))

3. Shortest Word
Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).
String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types

#3 Solution
def find_short(s):
    l = map(len,s.split())
    return min(l)
s = "bitcoin take over the world maybe who knows perhaps"
print(find_short(s))
